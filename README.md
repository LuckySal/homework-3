### Usage
To use the site, click the "Generate Password" button. This will bring up a prompt:

![Prompt for password length](./screenshots/prompt-1.png)

Type a number between 8 and 128 (inclusive) to set the desired length of your password.

The next few prompts will ask if you want to use lowercase, uppercase, numeric and [special](https://owasp.org/www-community/password-special-characters) characters. Click on "OK" to add them, or "Cancel" to exclude them.

Finally, the new, random password should appear in the text box:

![A random password appears!](./screenshots/new-password.png)

You can highlight the password with your mouse, then copy and paste it elsewhere.

**Warning**: Make sure to save your new password somewhere! I am not liable for forgotten passwords.
